## Interactive Project Description

### Azureowl
#### &lt;del>  
Work in progress menu that lets users apply the &lt;del> tag on items by clicking on their respective buttons.  	

* [index](../encyclopedia-entries-interactive/del-index.html)  (in progress)

#### background-attachment  
There will be three containers, each with applied background-attachment values of inherit, fixed, and local. Scroll will be the initial default of the body at the start of the interactive project; one container will inherit from body. Users will be able to apply property values to each container and the body.  

#### Math.PI  
There will be either a draggable circle or keyboard input fields to make changes to the diameter or radius. The circumference of the circle will change dynamically by the user inputs. The goal of this project is to interact with the diameter-circumference relationship and how Math.PI is useful for this.
